* Determine if queueEffectAdd/Remove events are worth it, or Effect and the queues should be more tightly integrated

* (directly) support more than one queue

* Add Queue positioning options (+think of possible Queue subclassing)

* Add Effect.Operators.Attribute

* Make debugger awesometastic (bar at bottom of window that shows timelines, allows stepping, inspection)

* Compatibility layer for effects 1.8? (questionable)

* Add reimplementations of 1.8 combined effects in addons

* reset classname in css operator

* Investigate auto-cpu-throttling via frame drop detection

* ADSR envelope transition engine?

MORE OR LESS THERE:

* Refactor Effect.Operators.Style

DONE:

* Add before/afterUpdate

* Add Element#fade/appear

* Fix heartbeat.stop

* reject invalid tweens in css operator

* IE auto-fix opacity (zoom:1)

* Effect.Operators.Style#applyValue -> don't setStyle again if values are identical
  -> with new tweens, individual properties can be tracked, yay
